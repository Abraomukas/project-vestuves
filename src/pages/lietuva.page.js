										We have all four seasons - it gets really cold during the
										winter, but it can also get really hot during the summer.
										There was a heatwave last year during which the temperature
										rose to around 38 C for a couple of weeks. Be aware that AC
										is not always available in Airbnbs (but mostly available in
										hotels). It is hard to say what the weather will be on the
										6th of July, but please keep in mind that it can be anything
										between +15 C and rain to +38 C and sun. But letâ€™s hope it
										is going to be +25 C and sunny. ðŸ˜‰

										Lithuania is much more north than some of you are used to -
										during June-July it is still light outside until around
										10pm.

										You are not likely to have any issues communicating in
										English in Vilnius or Kaunas. Unless you talk to a person
										above 40-50 years old. Then anything can happen.
